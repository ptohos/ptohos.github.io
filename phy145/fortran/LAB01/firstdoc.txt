 Deep Thoughts in front of a computer
 
 My God another horrible semester kicked off. I feel miserable sitting in this
 lab doing this boring excersice. Our professor seems of his mind. He wants
 us to do so many things and is trying to make us like something I really hate.
 At least spring is coming soon and I could even smell summer. Oh how nice is 
 summer. I had very good last year and I'm planning for a better one this year.
 I think I 'll get the gang to go for a safari. Very advantereous but I already
 see another jungle JUNGLE in front of me with so meny wild animals approaching.
